**French Political Network: Shape Your Future**
This was a University projct, the problem we had to solve was getting French citizens to participate in Politics. We solved this issue by building a web app, that was designed to empower French citizens to participate actively in politics. Hereâ€™s what our web app does:

\n**Stay Informed:** Get the latest news on political events and updates.
\n**Discover Your Alignment:** Participate in interactive quizzes to find the political party that aligns with your values.
**Vote:** Make your voice heard by voting for political parties.
**Attend Events:** Stay updated on political events happening near you.
